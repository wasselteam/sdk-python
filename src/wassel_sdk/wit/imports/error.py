class Error:
    """
    A resource which represents some error information.
    
    The only method provided by this resource is `to-debug-string`,
    which provides some human-readable information about the error.
    
    In the `wasi:io` package, this resource is returned through the
    `wasi:io/streams.stream-error` type.
    
    To provide more specific error information, other interfaces may
    offer functions to "downcast" this error into more specific types. For example,
    errors returned from streams derived from filesystem types can be described using
    the filesystem's own error-code type. This is done using the function
    `wasi:filesystem/types.filesystem-error-code`, which takes a `borrow<error>`
    parameter and returns an `option<wasi:filesystem/types.error-code>`.
    
    The set of functions which can "downcast" an `error` into a more
    concrete type is open.
